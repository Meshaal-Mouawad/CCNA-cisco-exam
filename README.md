<h1>Five Study Plan Steps</h1>
<p>What do you need to do to be ready to pass, beyond reading and remembering all the facts? You need to develop skills. You need to mentally link each idea with other related ideas. Doing that requires additional work. To help you along the way,There are five key planning steps to take so that you can more effectively build those skills and make those connections, before you dive into this exciting but challenging world of learning networking on Cisco gear.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Think in Terms of Parts and Chapters</h2>
The first step in your study plan is to get the right mindset about the size and nature of the task you have set out to accomplish. This is a large book, and to be ready for the CCNA 200-301 exam, you need to complete it and then _the CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide_, Volume 2. You cannot think about these two books as one huge task, or you might get discouraged. So break the task down into smaller tasks.

<p>The good news here is that the book is designed with obvious breakpoints and built-in extensive review activities. In short, the book is more of a study system than a book.</p>

The first step in your study plan is to visualize this book not as one large book but as components. First, visualize the book as eight smaller parts. Then, within each part, visualize each part as three or four chapters. Your study plan has you working through the chapters in each part  and then reviewing the material in that part before moving on, as shown in Figure 2.

<h3>Now your plan has the following:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>1 large task: Read and master all content in the book.</li>
	<li>8 medium tasks/book: Read and master a part.</li>
	<li>4 small tasks/part: Read and master a chapter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2: Build Your Study Habits Around the Chapter</h2>
For your second step, possibly the most important step, approach each chapter with the same process as shown in Figure 3. The chapter pre-quiz (called a DIKTA quiz, or “Do I Know This Already?” quiz) helps you decide how much time to spend reading versus skimming the core of the chapter, called the “Foundation Topics.” The “Chapter Review” section then gives you instructions about how to study and review what you just read.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72484101/197928131-9532c97c-138f-42fd-b763-3ed6ba1d02e5.png)

The book has no long chapters, on purpose. They average about 20 pages for the Foundation Topics (which is the part of the chapter with new content). Because we kept the size reasonable, you can complete all of a chapter in one or two short study sessions. For instance, when you begin a new chapter, if you have an hour or an hour and a half, you should be able to complete a first reading of the chapter and at least make a great start on it. And even if you do not have enough time to read the entire chapter, look for the major headings inside the chapter; each chapter has two to three major headings, and those make a great place to stop reading when you need to wait to complete the reading in the next study sessions.

The Chapter Review tasks are very important to your exam-day success. Doing these tasks after you’ve read the chapter really does help you get ready. Do not put off using these tasks until later! The chapter-ending review tasks help you with the first phase of deepening your knowledge and skills of the key topics, remembering terms, and linking the concepts together in your brain so that you can remember how it all fits together. The following list describes most of the activities you will find in the “Chapter Review” sections:

■ Review key topics

■ Review key terms

■ Answer the DIKTA questions

■ Re-create config checklists

■ Review command tables

■ Review memory tables

■ Do lab exercises

■ Watch video

■ Do subnetting exercises

<h2>Step 3: Use Book Parts for Major Milestones</h2>
<p> Studies show that to master a concept and/or skill, you should plan to go through multiple study sessions to review the concept and to practice the skill. The “Chapter Review” section at the end of each chapter is the first such review, while the Part Review, at the end of each part, acts as that second review.</p>
<p>Plan time to do the Part Review task at the end of each part, using the Part Review elements found at the end of each part. You should expect to spend about as much time on one Part Review as you would on one entire chapter. So in terms of planning your time, think of the Part Review itself as another chapter.</p>

<p> Figure 4 lists the names of the parts in this book, with some color coding. Note that Parts II and III are related (Ethernet), and Parts IV through VII are also related (IP version 4 and IP Version 6). Each part ends with a Part Review section of two to four pages, with notes about what tools and activities to use.</p>

<h2> Step 4: Use Volume 2’s Final Review Chapter</h2>
Your fourth step has one overall task: perform the details outlined in the “Final Exam Review” chapter at the end of the CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 2. Note that you have no exam to take at the end of this Volume 1 book, so keep working with Volume 2 when you complete this book. Once you’re finished with both books, Volume 2’s “Final Exam Review” will direct you.

<h2> Step 5: Set Goals and Track Your Progress </h2>
<p> Your fifth study plan step spans the entire timeline of your study effort. Before you start reading the book and doing the rest of these study tasks, take the time to make a plan, set some goals, and be ready to track your progress.</p>
<p>While making lists of tasks may or may not appeal to you depending on your personality, goal setting can help everyone studying for these exams. And to do the goal setting, you need to know what tasks you plan to do.</p>

<p> As for the list of tasks to do when studying, you do not have to use a detailed task list. (You could list every single task in every chapter-ending “Chapter Review” section, every task in the Part Reviews, and every task in the “Final Review” chapter.) However, listing the major tasks can be enough.
	
You should track at least two tasks for each typical chapter: reading the “Foundation Topics” section and doing the Chapter Review at the end of the chapter. And, of course, do not forget to list tasks for Part Reviews and Final Review. Table 1 shows a sample for Part I of this book. </p>
