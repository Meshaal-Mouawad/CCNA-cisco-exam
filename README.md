# Five Study Plan Steps
What do you need to do to be ready to pass, beyond reading and remembering all the facts? You
need to develop skills. You need to mentally link each idea with other related ideas. Doing that
requires additional work. To help you along the way, the next few pages give you five key planning
steps to take so that you can more effectively build those skills and make those connections,
before you dive into this exciting but challenging world of learning networking on Cisco gear.

## Step 1: Think in Terms of Parts and Chapters
The first step in your study plan is to get the right mindset about the size and nature of the
task you have set out to accomplish. This is a large book, and to be ready for the CCNA
200-301 exam, you need to complete it and then _the CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide_,
Volume 2. You cannot think about these two books as one huge task, or you might get discouraged.
So break the task down into smaller tasks.

The good news here is that the book is designed with obvious breakpoints and built-in extensive
review activities. In short, the book is more of a study system than a book.

The first step in your study plan is to visualize this book not as one large book but as components.
First, visualize the book as eight smaller parts. Then, within each part, visualize each part as three or four chapters. Your study plan has you working through the chapters in each part  and then reviewing the material in that part before moving on, as shown in Figure 2.

**Now your plan has the following:**

**1 large task:** Read and master all content in the book.

**8 medium tasks/book**: Read and master a part.

**4 small tasks/part:** Read and master a chapter.
